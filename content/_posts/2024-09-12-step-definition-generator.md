# Cucumber Step Definition Generator

This extension is designed to help developers using the testing framework with Gherkin style feature files to generate step definition more easily and efficiently. With just a few clicks, you can automatically generate step definition for your feature files, saving you time and reducing the risk of errors.

# Installation

Get it from [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nguyenngoclong.cypress-cucumber-step-definition-generator) or [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/nguyenngoclong/cypress-cucumber-step-definition-generator).

# Features

-   [Cucumber Step Definition Generator](#using-the-extension) offers multiple options to generate step definition.
-   Automatically opens the generated step definition file and syncs it with the currently opened window if you are in split editor mode. This saves you time and increases efficiency by allowing you to quickly view and edit the generated file.
-   Automatically detecting various types of information, such as `DataTable`, `DocString`, `int`, `float`, `string`, and other types of information that are supported by **[Gherkin Syntax](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/)**.
-   The automatic detection of an asterisk (*) will be defined by a keyword type in the preceding steps.
-   Additionally, step definition are de-duplicated when regenerating code, ensuring they remain organized and efficient, even when making changes to your testing scenario.

## Using the extension 

![Generate step definition](https://github.com/nguyenngoclongdev/step-definition-generator/raw/HEAD/images/generate-step-definition-from-editor-title.gif)

You have multiple options when it comes to generating step definition using this extension:

-   The extension can automatically create a new file for the step definition when you generate it. To do this, you can either right-click on the feature file or click an icon in the Editor Actions menu.
-   The extension can also generate the step definition and copy it to the clipboard, which makes it easy to access and paste into the appropriate file. To use this option, you can again right-click on the feature file or click an icon in the Editor Actions menu.
-   Finally, you can use the Command Palette within the extension to generate step definitions directly. This method may be particularly useful if you prefer to use keyboard shortcuts or if you're working with a particularly large or complex test file.

### Generate a step definition and create a new file

1. Open any .feature file in vs code editor
2. Right click on the editor and select `Generate step definition to file`
3. If the file for the step definition doesn't exist, the extension will create it. Otherwise, if the file already exists, the extension will simply append the new step definition to the end of the existing file.

### Generate a step definition and copy to clipboard

1. Open any .feature file in vs code editor
2. Right click on the editor and select `Generate step definition to clipboard`

![Generate step definition](https://github.com/nguyenngoclongdev/step-definition-generator/raw/HEAD/images/generate-step-definition-to-clipboard.gif)

### Generate step definition from Command Palette

1. Open the Command Palette with Ctrl + Shift + P or Cmd + Shift + P.
2. Search for "Generate step definition" and select "Generate step definition to clipboard or Generate step definition to file".
3. Press Enter to generate the step definition.

}
```

## Examples

```feature
@web @regression
Feature: Search functionality

    As a user,
    I want to be able to search for products on the website,
    So that I can find what I need quickly and easily.

    Background:
        Given I am on the home page
        And I am logged in as "user@example.com"

    Rule: Search by keyword

        Scenario: Search with a valid keyword
            When I enter "laptop" in the search bar
            And I click the search button
            Then I should see a list of products containing "laptop"
            And the total number of results should be 10

        Scenario Outline: Search with invalid keyword
            When I enter <keyword> in the search bar
            And I click the search button
            Then I should see an error message

            Examples:
                | keyword   |
                | 12345     |
                | $%^&*     |
                | "invalid" |

    Rule: Search by category

        Scenario: Search for a specific category
            When I select "Electronics" from the category dropdown
            And I click the search button
            Then I should see a list of products in the Electronics category
            And the total number of results should be a float value between 10.0 and 20.0

        Scenario Outline: Search with multiple categories
            When I select the following categories:
                | category    |
                | Electronics |
                | Clothing    |
            And I click the search button
            Then I should see a list of products in the selected categories
            And the total number of results should be an integer value

    Rule: Search with filters

        Scenario: Search with filters applied
            When I select "Brand A" from the brand filter
            And I select "Price > $100" from the price filter
            And I click the search button
            Then I should see a list of products that match the applied filters
            And the total number of results should be greater than 0

    Rule: Search with docstring and datatable

        Scenario: Search with advanced options
            When I click the "Advanced Search" link
            And I fill in the following information:
                """
                {
                    "category": "Electronics",
                    "brand": "Brand B",
                    "priceRange": [
                        50,
                        100
                    ],
                    "features": [
                        {
                            "name": "WiFi",
                            "value": "Yes"
                        },
                        {
                            "name": "Bluetooth",
                            "value": "No"
                        }
                    ]
                }
                """
            And I click the search button
            Then I should see a list of products that match the advanced search criteria
            And the total number of results should be a float value
